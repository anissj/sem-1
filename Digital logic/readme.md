# Digital Logic

## Lab 1

In this lab session, we are introduced to breadboard and basic integrated circuit (IC) gates such as AND gate, OR gate, and NOT gate. We learn how to properly insert the IC gate into the breadboard and remove them. We also get the chance to build a simple circuit using these gates.

Students are exposed to producing digital logic circuits, generating truth tables, and Timing Diagram with Deeds Simulator. Students also applied the duality symbol which converts AND-OR circuits to NAND gates.

## Lab 3

During Lab 3, we need to build a count-up and count-down circuit using J-K flip flop. We successfully build the circuit and produce the 7-segment output.
