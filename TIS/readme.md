 <summary>REFLECTION</summary></br>
  <p> Through the PC assembly lab, I have gained an in-depth understanding of the internal hardware components of a CPU. This hands-on experience is a great opportunity for me to learn and see the internal structure of a PC with the help and guidance of technicians who are experts in computer hardware. Some of the hardware I get to see are random access memory (RAM), hard disk drive (HDD), computer fan, and cables. While handling this hardware, I was so nervous as I realized how fragile it was. Additionally, me and my groupmates managed to be the first group to reassemble the PC after disassembling it which made me so proud. </p>

  <summary>REFLECTION</summary></br>
  <p>   The visit to UTM Digital has made me more passionate about data management as I get to see the data center or database that stores all the data in UTM. I am amazed by how the staff maintains the database. Moreover, the staff explained how they solved the problems reported by students and other staff.
  Furthermore, I got to feel the working environment there as I visited the meeting room and open area. It is relaxed and calm as they say we also need to take care of our mental health while working.</p>

[3. Industrial Visit](https://github.com/anissj/sem-1/blob/main/TIS/Industrial%20Visit%20Newsletter.pdf)

<details>
  
  <summary>REFLECTION</summary></br>
  <p>  The industrial visit to Petronas and Huawei was an exciting experience and incredibly enlightening. The sharing session about their expertise and high-tech products expanded my view on and knowledge of technological innovation. As both companies are big and well-known companies, there are a lot of advanced technologies used to enhance their performance. Increased productivity and efficiency as well as better communication and teamwork are just a few advantages of technology improvements. Getting to see the technologies with my own two eyes was a great opportunity as it cannot be seen everywhere. There are even technologies that I have never heard of before and this experience motivates me to deepen my knowledge about technologies. Also, the importance of continuous learning and adapting in the rapidly evolving world of technology was emphasized in the talk. Therefore, in the future, I intend to keep improving myself and acquire new knowledge so that I can be the best version of myself. </p>

<details>
  
  <summary>REFLECTION</summary></br>
  <p>   From the talk given, I have a better vision of what my future career will look like and what improvement is essential to becoming a system developer. Additionally, the talk also highlighted the importance of lifelong learning in this computer science field as there are many technologies used by each company. This led me to set a goal for the future to continuously learn and gain more knowledge, especially about computer science such as learning other programming languages and exposing myself to different kinds of technologies.  The talk given by Ms. Qistina who works for the Credence Company gives us examples of technologies used by their companyâ€”for instance,  ClickHouse, PostgreSQL, and Metabase. </p>
