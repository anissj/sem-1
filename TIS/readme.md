  <p>   From the talk given by PPG and GetMe Hired, I am able to know the real-life working cultures and experiences. Moreover, the advice given by the UTM alumni has become one of my motivations to pursue this field as it is relatable to me. Also, they gave us tips on what is needed to work on in order to get employed on the job I wanted. </p>

  <p>   The visit to UTM Digital has made me become more passionate about data mangement as I get to see the data center or database that stores all the data in UTM. I am amazed by how the staff maintains the database. Moreover, the staff explained how they solved the problems that were reported by students and other staff.
  Furthermore, I got to feel the working environment there as I visited the meeting room and open area. It is relaxed and calm as they say we also need to take care of our mental health while working.</p>
